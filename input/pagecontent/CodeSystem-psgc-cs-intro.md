The **Philippine Standard Geographic Code** (**PSGC**) is a systematic classification and coding for geographic areas in the Philippines. It classifies areas based on the country's [four levels of administrative divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_the_Philippines "Administrative divisions of the Philippines"): regions, provinces, municipalities or cities, and [barangays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barangay "Barangay").<sup id="cite_ref-Gov_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Standard_Geographic_Code#cite_note-Gov-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-PSGC_2-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Standard_Geographic_Code#cite_note-PSGC-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
