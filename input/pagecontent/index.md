# Welcome to the Experimental FHIR Implementation Guide for PSA Ontologies

This guide presents an experimental implementation of HL7® FHIR® standards tailored to the ontological frameworks of the **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)**. The PSA is the central statistical authority of the Philippines, responsible for collecting, compiling, analyzing, and publishing statistical information on the country’s economic, social, demographic, and general activities and conditions.

## Purpose and Motivation

This work is driven by the goal of supporting the development and adoption of FHIR standards in the Philippines. By aligning national statistical classifications with FHIR, we aim to enhance interoperability, data consistency, and semantic clarity across health and administrative systems.

## Current Scope

This guide incorporates a foundational model of the **Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC)**—a structured classification of geographic areas in the Philippines. The PSGC ontology provides a basis for location-based data interoperability within FHIR resources.

## Future Directions

We envision expanding this work to include additional PSA-maintained standards, such as:

- **Philippine Standard Classification of Education (PSCEd)**
- **Philippine Standard Occupational Classification (PSOC)**

These extensions will further enrich the semantic landscape of FHIR implementations in the country, supporting more comprehensive and context-aware data exchange.
